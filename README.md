### 👋 Hello, World!

- I'm Vincent, located in Paris, France.
- I am working closely on MLOps and software engineering aspects of machine learning projects.
- I use Linux (NixOS). I'm always looking to discover and try out new OSS, especially those that can be self-hosted.

#### ⚙️ Homelab

I have my own homelab, and all of its configurations are public and open source:

- [homelab](https://github.com/VDuchauffour/homelab/): contains everything related to my homelab, which is as a Kubernetes cluster.
